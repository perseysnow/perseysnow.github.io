        <p>Gloamfield local Clairy Osur has spent the last month protesting in front of town hall. At issue is the
            presence
            of the native giant spiders of the Webwood. Standing outside her home in the Webwood's biggest town, she
            gestures to the famous webs that gave the region its name. “It's just awful!” she complains. “I moved here
            looking for a quiet life in the forest. Instead I can't go frolicking in the woods because of spiders bigger
            than I am!”<br>We asked the provincal government, local government, and the Silk Farmer's Union for comment,
            but none responded.</p>

        <p> Enchanting giant Blue Knight Inc. has announced they will be adopting the very same automated rune-crafting
            system that saw their biggest competitor, collapse earlier this year. “It's been seven months,” Blue Knight
            CEO says. “It'll be fine. Auto-crafters have been around long enough we know what happens when they're
            introduced to a business.”
            Expeditions Enchanted, who filed for bankruptcy earlier this year after adopting this technology lead to a
            customer revolt has simply said, “We wish BK all the best and hope this works out for them.” </p>
