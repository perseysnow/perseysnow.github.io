            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p class="text" id="history">Founded in the first season of the Storm Age, shortly after the Shattered Isles
                were captured by the Kestrel's Fleet. The C&A was started by Bethan Sparrow, who had served as cook
                aboard the Peregrine, the fleet's flagship. It quickly became a local favourite, offering a warm meal
                and a safe place to socialize. Even today, if you're looking for something good to eat or the sharp bite
                of cider straight from the Hidden Gardens, the C&A has you covered.<br>Don't forget to us on Friday nights for a
                showcase of local music!</p>
